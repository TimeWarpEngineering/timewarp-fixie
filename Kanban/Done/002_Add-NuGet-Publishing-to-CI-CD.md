# 002_Add-NuGet-Publishing-to-CI-CD.md

## Description

Add automated NuGet package publishing to the CI/CD workflow. Currently, there is a manual [`publish.ps1`](publish.ps1:1) script that handles the publishing process, but this should be integrated into an automated CI/CD pipeline to ensure consistent and reliable package releases.

## Requirements

- Create CI/CD workflow configuration (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, or similar)
- Integrate the existing publish script logic into the CI/CD pipeline
- Ensure secure handling of NuGet API key through environment variables/secrets
- Trigger publishing on version tags or specific branch pushes
- Include build, test, and pack steps before publishing
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing manual process during transition
- Add proper error handling and logging

## Checklist

### Design
- [x] Choose CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, etc.)
- [x] Design workflow trigger strategy (tags, branches, manual)
- [x] Plan secret/environment variable management for NuGet API key

### Implementation
- [x] Create CI/CD folder structure
- [x] Move/adapt [`publish.ps1`](publish.ps1:1) logic to CI/CD workflow
- [x] Add build and test steps to workflow
- [x] Configure NuGet package creation step
- [x] Implement NuGet publishing step with proper authentication
- [x] Add conditional logic for when to publish (version tags, etc.)
- [x] Test workflow in development environment

### Configuration
- [ ] Set up required secrets/environment variables
- [ ] Configure workflow permissions
- [ ] Add status badges to README if applicable

### Documentation
- [x] Update README.md with CI/CD information
- [x] Document the new publishing process
- [x] Add troubleshooting guide for CI/CD issues
- [ ] Update .ai prompts if needed

### Review
- [ ] Consider Security Implications (secure secret handling)
- [ ] Consider Performance Implications (workflow execution time)
- [ ] Consider Monitoring and Alerting Implications (build notifications)
- [ ] Consider Accessibility Implications (N/A for CI/CD)
- [ ] Code Review

## Notes

Current [`publish.ps1`](publish.ps1:1) script includes:
- Environment validation (`$env:Nuget_Key` check)
- Tool restoration (`dotnet tool restore`)
- Cleanup (`dotnet cleanup -y`)
- Package creation (`dotnet pack ./source/TimeWarp.Fixie/TimeWarp.Fixie.csproj -c Release`)
- NuGet publishing (`dotnet nuget push **/*.nupkg --source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json --api-key $env:Nuget_Key`)

The CI/CD implementation should preserve this functionality while adding:
- Automated triggering
- Better error handling
- Build/test validation before publishing
- Proper logging and status reporting

## Implementation Notes

### Completed Implementation (2025-06-04)

**Architecture Decision: PowerShell-First Approach**
- Created modular PowerShell scripts in [`CI-CD/`](CI-CD/) folder for easy local testing
- Minimal GitHub Actions wrapper that calls PowerShell scripts
- This approach allows thorough testing without GitHub Actions overhead

**Created Files:**
1. [`CI-CD/ci-cd.ps1`](CI-CD/ci-cd.ps1) - Main orchestration script
2. [`CI-CD/build-and-test.ps1`](CI-CD/build-and-test.ps1) - Build and test phase
3. [`CI-CD/publish-nuget.ps1`](CI-CD/publish-nuget.ps1) - NuGet publishing phase
4. [`CI-CD/README.md`](CI-CD/README.md) - Comprehensive documentation
5. [`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml) - GitHub Actions workflow

**Key Features Implemented:**
- ✅ Preserves all functionality from original [`publish.ps1`](../publish.ps1)
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and logging with colored output
- ✅ Modular design allows running individual phases
- ✅ Local testing capability: `./CI-CD/ci-cd.ps1 -Phase build`
- ✅ Secure API key handling via environment variables
- ✅ GitHub Actions integration with artifact management
- ✅ Conditional publishing on GitHub releases only

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Local build test successful: 13 tests passed, 1 skipped
- ✅ Package creation successful: `TimeWarp.Fixie.3.1.0.nupkg`
- ✅ All build warnings are expected (IL2070, NU5100)

**Migration Path:**
- Original [`publish.ps1`](../publish.ps1) can remain for manual use
- New CI/CD system provides automated alternative
- Both systems use same underlying dotnet commands

**Remaining Tasks:**
- Set up `NUGET_API_KEY` secret in GitHub repository settings
- Test full workflow with actual GitHub release
- Consider adding status badges to main README
